Reflecting on My Shoppie: My First HTML & CSS Journey 🌟

Back in 2021, I set off on my coding adventure, and HTML & CSS felt like pure magic. Today, I want to share my journey with "My Shoppie," my very first website creation.
---The Beginner's Excitement ---
HTML & CSS? They were like real-life magic!🌈 Imagine typing something and instantly seeing it on the screen – it was a total rush for a newbie like me! 
"My Shoppie" may not be perfect, but it's a reminder of where I began. I started with the login page, the home page, and a gallery showcasing the latest releases🏗 .
Embracing imperfections is part of the learning journey. "My Shoppie" might not be flawless, but it's a snapshot of my progress as a coder. 📈
Celebrating those small victories! Each line of code was a milestone, and I cherished every moment of the learning process. 🎉
Learning is a continuous journey🌱. "My Shoppie" reminds me of where I started and how far I've come. It's proof that with dedication, anyone can learn to code. 💪
From that beginner's excitement to the imperfect yet valuable "My Shoppie," my HTML & CSS journey has been a thrilling ride. Here's to the coder in me who started with a dream and is still reaching for the stars! ✨

PS- I never revisited the project after 2021; I preserved it as a souvenir
